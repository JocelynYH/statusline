agnostermod
===========

####A theme for oh-my-zsh

See the theme "agnoster" for comparison. This version works with the latest updates without formatting errors, and has some more (git + status) information as well as other goodies compared to the original. I have particularly focused on speed within git repos. (make sure ```DISABLE_UNTRACKED_FILES_DIRTY``` is set to ```true``` in .zshrc for faster performance!)

NOTE: Mercurial/any other version management besides git is not currently supported, for performance reasons.
