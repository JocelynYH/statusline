agnostermod
===========

####A theme for oh-my-zsh

See the theme "agnoster" for comparison. This version works with the latest updates without formatting errors, and has more git information and features compared to the original. I have attempted to optimize checking in large git repos. (make sure ```DISABLE_UNTRACKED_FILES_DIRTY``` is set to ```true``` in your ```.zshrc``` file for faster performance!)

NOTE: Mercurial support is untested. There is also a custom character used for the branch that can be replaced with the generic character, if you so choose.
