####A theme for prezto and oh-my-zsh

See the theme "agnoster" for comparison. This version works with the latest updates without formatting errors, and has more git information and features compared to the original. I have attempted to optimize checking in large git repos. (If using oh-my-zsh, make sure `DISABLE_UNTRACKED_FILES_DIRTY` is set to `true` in your `.zshrc` file for faster performance!)

The prezto version is more optimized for zsh and runs much faster. It also shows more git information, among other enhancements. Since it uses the prezto git module, it is not compatible with oh-my-zsh. However, I recommend prezto over oh-my-zsh because of faster prompts and less startup time.

NOTE: Mercurial support is untested and only for oh-my-zsh version. There is also a custom character used for the branch that can be replaced with the generic character, if you so choose.
